# üìä Alior & ING Bank Stock Closing Price Analysis with MS Excel and R

### üí° Idea of the Project

During my undergraduate studies, I took a course in statistics. Although I had excellent instructors, I often struggled to understand the practical purpose of the concepts we were learning and how the statistical methods I applied would be used in real-world contexts. At the time, I didn‚Äôt fully grasp the meaning behind the statistics I was calculating.

It was only after completing the course that I realized my interest in pursuing a career in Data Science. Through completing DataCamp courses and studying materials from the StatQuest channel, I was able to connect theoretical knowledge into a coherent framework.

However, this was still mostly theoretical, so I decided to revisit and expand a project from the statistics course, this time with a clear understanding of the concepts involved. The goal of this project is to consolidate my knowledge from my studies, online courses, and educational videos, applying it in a practical and meaningful way.

### ‚ùó Problem Statement

This project addresses the challenge of understanding the behavior of Alior and ING bank stock data, focusing on both single-variable and joint analyses. The primary problem is to identify the most appropriate continuous distribution models for the closing prices of each stock and to interpret the resulting statistical characteristics. At the same time, the project examines the relationships between stock returns through covariance and correlation analysis, exploring the joint distribution in a two-dimensional context. Another key challenge is to apply linear regression to model the joint behavior of the returns and to rigorously validate the model‚Äôs performance. The ultimate goal is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights from both the univariate and bivariate analyses, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of these bank stocks.

### üóÇ Source

The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock closing prices for Alior Bank and ING Bank ≈ölƒÖski. The data was obtained from Stooq, a reliable financial database, covering the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2024. This data provides the basis for both univariate and bivariate analyses, enabling the exploration of distribution models, statistical relationships, and regression-based modeling.
